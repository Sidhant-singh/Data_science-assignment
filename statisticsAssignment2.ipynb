    "Mean: The mean is calculated by summing up all the values in a dataset and dividing by the total number of values. It represents the average value of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median: The median is the middle value in a dataset when the values are arranged in ascending or descending order. If there is an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values. The median represents the middle value of the dataset and is less affected by extreme values than the mean.\n",

    "\n",
    "Mean: The mean is the sum of all the values in a dataset divided by the total number of values. It is sensitive to extreme values (outliers) and tends to be affected by them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median: The median is the middle value in a dataset when the values are arranged in order. It is less affected by extreme values compared to the mean. It represents the central value of the dataset.\n",
